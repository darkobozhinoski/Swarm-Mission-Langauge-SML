# Swarm Mission Language (SML)


We present the implementation of the Swarm Mission Language grammar. To specify a mission, you need to download the Eclipse project. 
The five subprojects can be imported in Eclipse Version: 2019-12 (4.14.0) with Xtext 2.21.0.
An Eclipse plug-in of the Swarm Mission Language Grammar can be built by right-clicking the project called "be.ulb.missionspecification", selecting "Run as", 
"Eclipse Application". This will spawn a new instance of Eclipse, with the plug-in loaded. In the new instance, create a new Java project, 
and create a file with extension ".sml", i.e., the extension of Mission Specification files. In the text editor, the Mission Specification Language can be used 
(including parse error visualisation, ctrl-tab, hierarchy, etc.).

# Swarm Mission Language (SML)

This repo contains the Swarm Mission Language grammar. To specify a mission, you need to download the Eclipse project. 
The five subprojects can be imported in Eclipse Version: 2019-12 (4.14.0) with Xtext 2.21.0.

An Eclipse plug-in of the Swarm Mission Language Grammar can be built by right-clicking the project called "be.ulb.missionspecification", selecting "Run as", 
"Eclipse Application". This will spawn a new instance of Eclipse, with the plug-in loaded. In the new instance, create a new Java project, 
and create a file with extension ".sml". In the text editor, you can specify a swarm mission using the Swarm Mission Language (SML).

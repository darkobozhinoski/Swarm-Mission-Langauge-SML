# Swarm Mission Language (SML)

This repo contains the Swarm Mission Language grammar. To specify a mission, you need to download the Eclipse project. 
The five subprojects can be imported in Eclipse Version: 2019-12 (4.14.0) with Xtext 2.21.0.

An Eclipse plug-in of the Swarm Mission Language Grammar can be built by right-clicking the project called "be.ulb.missionspecification", selecting "Run as", 
"Eclipse Application". This will spawn a new instance of Eclipse, with the plug-in loaded. In the new instance, create a new Java project, 
and create a file with extension ".sml". In the text editor, you can specify a swarm mission using the Swarm Mission Language (SML).

We demonstrate the applicability of the language in 3 different missions. In the demonstration, we use e-puck robot. Suppplementary materials for the 3 different missions is given on the following link: https://iridia.ulb.ac.be/supp/IridiaSupp2020-013/index.html
